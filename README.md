## Data and machinelearning project for the Finnish company

### Content of the project
- The main goal of the project was to implement ML model which can be used to predict the temperature of the water of ventilation machine. The purpose of forecasting is to make optimizations for heating system and save its costs.
- The customer of the project was [AdConSys Oy](https://adconsys.fi/), which develops building automation systems and ventilation machines.
- In this project, we used **neural networks** (PyTorch) for solving the problem. Both regression and classification models have been implemented.

**The aim of the project** was to find out which factors are essential for predicting the right temperature, and to create an in-depth machine learning model (neural network) based on the data obtained.
#### The project also included:
-  Data cleaning
-  Data analysis
-  Data mining & wrangling
-  Selecting ML method and its implementation
