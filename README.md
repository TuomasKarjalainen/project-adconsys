## Data and machinelearning project for the Finnish company

### Content of the project
- The main goal of the project was to implement ML model which can be used to predict the temperature of the water of ventilation machine.
- The customer of the project was Adconsys Oy, which develops building automation systems and ventilation machines.
- In this project, we used neural networks (PyTorch) for solving the problem.

**The aim of the project** was to find out which factors are essential for predicting the right temperature, and to create an in-depth machine learning model (neural network) based on the data obtained.
#### The project also included:
-  Data cleaning
-  Data analysis
-  Data mining & wrangling
-  Selecting ML method and its implementation
